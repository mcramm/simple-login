# simple-login

A Leiningen template to quickly get set up with a login/registration page. It
also sets up some basic storage options (in-memory and postgres).

The page has no styling applied to it and is pretty bare-bones.

# Installation

This project isn't on clojars yet, so you'll need to clone down this repo and
install it locally with Leiningen.

From this projects root, run `lein install` then follow the usage steps below

## Usage

*NOTE*: Use at your own risk. This template should be a good bare-bones place to
get started, but I would evaluate it before using it in production.

`lein new simple-login <your-project-name>`

## Contributing

Pull Requests and feedback are welcome. I threw this together in a few hours, so
I'm missing some key things (like tests :scream:), and the code could use some
refactoring.
